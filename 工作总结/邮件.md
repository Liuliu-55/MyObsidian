Hi Professor xxx :

Thank you for reading!
I am a prospective graduate student from China.
My research is focused on Radar Semantic Segmentation. I have recently read your paper: "High-resolution radar road segmentation using weakly supervised learning". The  work was so interesting and it was attractive to me.
I am wondering if you could kindly send me the dataset and the necessary information about it. I promise they will be used only for research purposed.
      Thank you very much for your kind consideration and I am looking forward to your early reply.

All the best,

Liu Liu
